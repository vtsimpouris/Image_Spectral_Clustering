# Image_Spectral_Clustering
Implementation of Image Color Clustering using Matlab

The project is based on the method of Ncuts 
(Shi J, Malik J Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation, University of Pennsylvania 2000)

Demo's can be run standalone using only Matlab

Ncuts is a graph based metric used alongside basic clustering algorithms (like kmeans)
in order to segment parts of an image.

Example of Image Segmentation:

Left is original images, rights is the colored clusters
